.# Abstract 

This document defines the pushed authorization request endpoint, which allows
clients to push the payload of an OAuth 2.0 authorization request to the
authorization server via a direct request and provides them
with a request URI that is used as reference to the data in a subsequent authorization request.   

# Introduction {#Introduction}

In OAuth [@!RFC6749] authorization request parameters are typically sent as URI query 
parameters via redirection in the user-agent. This is simple but also yields challenges:

* There is no cryptographical integrity and authenticity protection, i.e. the request can be modified on its way through the user-agent and attackers can impersonate legitimate clients.
* There is no mechanism to ensure confidentiality of the request parameters.
* Authorization request URLs can become quite large, especially in scenarios requiring fine-grained authorization data.

JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq] provides solutions for those challenges by allowing OAuth clients to wrap authorization request parameters in a signed, and optionally encrypted, JSON Web Token (JWT), the so-called "Request Object". 

In order to cope with the size restrictions, JAR introduces the `request_uri` parameter that allows clients to send a reference to a request object instead of the request object itself.    

This document complements JAR by providing an interoperable way to push the payload of a request object directly to the AS in exchange for a `request_uri`.

It also allows for clients to push the form encoded authorization request parameters to the AS in order to   
exchange them for a request URI that the client can use in a subsequent authorization request. 

For example, the following authorization request,

```
  GET /authorize?response_type=code
   &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=af0ifjsldkj
   &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
       
```
