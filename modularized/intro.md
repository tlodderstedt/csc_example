# Abstract 

This document defines the pushed authorization request endpoint, which allows
clients to push the payload of an OAuth 2.0 authorization request to the
authorization server via a direct request and provides them
with a request URI that is used as reference to the data in a subsequent authorization request.   

# Introduction {#Introduction}

OAuth ([RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)) authorization request parameters are typically sent as URI query parameters via redirection in the user-agent. This is simple but also yields challenges:

* There is no cryptographical integrity and authenticity protection, i.e. the request can be modified on its way through the user-agent and attackers can impersonate legitimate clients.
* There is no mechanism to ensure confidentiality of the request parameters.
* Authorization request URLs can become quite large, especially in scenarios requiring fine-grained authorization data.

...

For example, the following authorization request,

```HTTP
  GET /authorize?response_type=code
   &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=af0ifjsldkj
   &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
       
```
