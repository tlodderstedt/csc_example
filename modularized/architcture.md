.# Abstract 

This document defines the pushed authorization request endpoint, which allows
clients to push the payload of an OAuth 2.0 authorization request to the
authorization server via a direct request and provides them
with a request URI that is used as reference to the data in a subsequent authorization request.   

{mainmatter}

# Introduction {#Introduction}

In OAuth [@!RFC6749] authorization request parameters are typically sent as URI query 
parameters via redirection in the user-agent. This is simple but also yields challenges:

* There is no cryptographical integrity and authenticity protection, i.e. the request can be modified on its way through the user-agent and attackers can impersonate legitimate clients.
* There is no mechanism to ensure confidentiality of the request parameters.
* Authorization request URLs can become quite large, especially in scenarios requiring fine-grained authorization data.

JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq] provides solutions for those challenges by allowing OAuth clients to wrap authorization request parameters in a signed, and optionally encrypted, JSON Web Token (JWT), the so-called "Request Object". 

In order to cope with the size restrictions, JAR introduces the `request_uri` parameter that allows clients to send a reference to a request object instead of the request object itself.    

This document complements JAR by providing an interoperable way to push the payload of a request object directly to the AS in exchange for a `request_uri`.

It also allows for clients to push the form encoded authorization request parameters to the AS in order to   
exchange them for a request URI that the client can use in a subsequent authorization request. 

For example, the following authorization request,

```
  GET /authorize?response_type=code
   &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=af0ifjsldkj
   &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
       
```

could be pushed directly to the AS by the client as follows,

```
  POST /as/par HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0Mzo3RmpmcDBaQnIxS3REUmJuZlZkbUl3

  response_type=code
  &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=af0ifjsldkj
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
```

The AS responds with a request URI,  

```
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
  Content-Type: application/json
    
  {

    "request_uri": "urn:example:bwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2",
    "expires_in": 90
  }
```

which is used by the client in the subsequent authorization request as follows,

```
  GET /authorize?request_uri=
    urn%3Aexample%3Abwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2 HTTP/1.1
```

The pushed authorization request endpoint thus fosters OAuth security by providing all clients a simple means for an integrity protected authorization request, but it also allows clients requiring an even higher security level, especially cryptographically confirmed non-repudiation, to explicitly adopt JWT-based request objects.   

## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This specification uses the terms "access token", "refresh token",
"authorization server", "resource server", "authorization endpoint",
"authorization request", "authorization response", "token endpoint",
"grant type", "access token request", "access token response", and
"client" defined by The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [@!RFC6749].

# Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint

The pushed authorization request endpoint shall be a RESTful API at the authorization server that accepts `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST requests.

The endpoint accepts the parameters defined in [@!RFC6749] for the authorization endpoint as well as all applicable extensions defined for the authorization endpoint. Some examples of such extensions include PKCE [@RFC7636], Resource Indicators [@I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators], and OpenID Connect [@OIDC].

The rules for client authentication as defined in [@!RFC6749] for token endpoint requests, including the applicable authentication methods, apply for the pushed authorization request endpoint as well. If applicable, the `token_endpoint_auth_method` client metadata parameter indicates the registered authentication method for the client to use when making direct requests to the authorization server, including requests to the pushed authorization endpoint. 

Note that there's some potential ambiguity around the appropriate audience 
value to use when JWT client assertion based authentication is employed. To address that ambiguity the issuer identifier URL of the AS according to [@!RFC8414] SHOULD be used as the value of the audience. In order to facilitate interoperability the AS MUST accept its issuer identifier, token endpoint URL, or pushed authorization request endpoint URL as values that identify it as an intended audience.

## Request {#request}

A client can send all the parameters that usually comprise an authorization request to the pushed authorization request endpoint. A basic parameter set will typically include:

* `response_type`
* `redirect_uri`
* `scope`
* `state` 
* `code_challenge`  
* `code_challenge_method`  

Depending on client type and authentication method, the request might also include the `client_id` parameter. The `request_uri` authorization request parameter MUST NOT be provided in this case (see (#request_parameter)).

The client adds the parameters in `x-www-form-urlencoded` format with a character encoding of UTF-8 as described in Appendix B of [@!RFC6749] to the body of a HTTP POST request. If applicable, the client also adds client credentials to the request header or the request body using the same rules as for token endpoint requests.

This is illustrated by the following example

```
  POST /as/par HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0Mzo3RmpmcDBaQnIxS3REUmJuZlZkbUl3

  response_type=code&
  state=af0ifjsldkj&
  client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
  redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb&
  code_challenge=K2-ltc83acc4h0c9w6ESC_rEMTJ3bww-uCHaoeK1t8U&
  code_challenge_method=S256&
  scope=ais
```

The AS MUST process the request as follows:

1. The AS MUST authenticate the client in same way as at the token endpoint.
2. The AS MUST validate the request the same way as at the authorization endpoint. For example, the authorization server checks whether the redirect URI matches one of the redirect URIs configured for the `client_id`. It MAY also check whether the client is authorized for the `scope` for which it is requesting access. This validation allows the authorization server to refuse unauthorized or fraudulent requests early. 

## Successful Response

If the verification is successful, the server shall generate a request URI and return a JSON response that contains `request_uri` and `expires_in` members at the top level with `201 Created` HTTP response code.

* `request_uri` : The request URI corresponding to the authorization request posted. This URI is used as reference to the respective request data in the subsequent authorization request only. The way the authorization process obtains the authorization request data is at the discretion of the authorization server and out of scope of this specification. There is no need to make the authorization request data available to other parties via this URI.
* `expires_in` : A JSON number that represents the lifetime of the request URI in seconds. The request URI lifetime is at the discretion of the AS.

The `request_uri` value MUST be generated using a cryptographically strong pseudorandom algorithm such that it is computationally infeasible to predict or guess a valid value.   

The `request URI` MUST be bound to the `client_id` of the client that posted the authorization request.

Since the request URI can be replayed, its lifetime SHOULD be short and preferably limited to one-time use.

The following is an example of such a response:

```
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  Date: Tue, 2 May 2017 15:22:31 GMT
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "request_uri": "urn:example:bwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2",
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
``` 

## Error Response {#error_response}

### Error responses

#### Authentication required
If the client authentication fails, the authorization server shall return `401 Unauthorized` HTTP error response.

#### Authorization required
If the client is not authorized to perform the authorization request it wanted to post, the authorization server shall return `403 Forbidden` HTTP error response.

#### Invalid request
If the request object received is invalid, the authorization server shall return `400 Bad Request` HTTP error response.

#### Method not allowed
If the request did not use POST, the authorization server shall return `405 Method Not Allowed` HTTP error response.

#### Request entity too large
If the request size was beyond the upper bound that the authorization server allows, the authorization server shall return a `413 Request Entity Too Large` HTTP error response.

#### Too many requests
If the request from the client per a time period goes beyond the number the authorization server allows, the authorization server shall return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error response.

# "request" Parameter {#request_parameter}

Clients MAY use the `request` parameter as defined in JAR to push a request object to the AS. The rules for signing and encryption of the request object as defined in JAR [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq] apply.  

Clients MUST NOT combine other authorization request parameters with the `request` parameter at the pushed authorization request endpoint other than the `client_id` parameter which may be a part of the client authentication mechanism.

The following is an example of a request using a signed request object. The client is authenticated using its client secret `BASIC` authorization:

```
  POST /as/par HTTP/1.1
  Host: as.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0Mzo3RmpmcDBaQnIxS3REUmJuZlZkbUl3

```

The AS needs to take the following steps beyond the processing rules defined in (#request):

1. If applicable, the AS decrypts the request object as specified in JAR [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq], section 6.1.
1. The AS validates the request object signature as specified in JAR [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq], section 6.2.
1. If the client is a confidential client, the authorization server MUST check whether the authenticated `client_id` matches the `client_id` claim in the request object. If they do not match, the authorization server MUST refuse to process the request. It is at the authorization server's discretion to require the `iss` claim to match the `client_id` as well.

## Error responses for Request Object
This section gives the error responses that go beyond the basic (#error_response).

### Authentication Required
If the signature validation fails, the authorization server shall return `401 Unauthorized` HTTP error response. The same applies if the `client_id` or, if applicable, the `iss` claims in the request object do not match the authenticated `client_id`.

# Authorization Request

The client uses the `request_uri` value as returned by the authorization server as authorization request parameter `request_uri`.

```
  GET /authorize?request_uri=
    urn%3Aexample%3Abwc4JK-ESC0w8acc191e-Y1LTC2 HTTP/1.1
```
Clients are encouraged to use the request URI as the only parameter in order to use the integrity and authenticity provided by the pushed authorization request.

# Authorization Server Metadata

If the authorization server has a pushed authorization request endpoint, it SHOULD include the following OAuth/OpenID Provider Metadata parameter in discovery responses:

`pushed_authorization_request_endpoint` : The URL of the pushed authorization request endpoint at which the client can exchange a request object for a request URI.


# Security Considerations

## Request URI Guessing
An attacker could attempt to guess and replay a valid request URI value and 
try to impersonat the respective client. The AS MUST consider the considerations
given in JAR [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq], section 10.2, clause d on request URI entropy.

## Request Object Replay
An attacker could replay a request URI captured from a legit authorization request. In order to cope with such attacks, the AS SHOULD make the request URIs one-time use.

## Client Policy Change
The client policy might change between the lodging of the request object and the 
authorization request using a particular request object. It is therefore recommended that the AS checks the request parameter against the client policy when processing the authorization request.
